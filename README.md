The Text Prediction Using LSTM project leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict the next word or sequence in a given text. By training on a large corpus of text data, the model learns patterns and context to generate coherent and contextually relevant predictions, enhancing applications like autocomplete and text generation.
